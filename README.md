# BioInformatics

This is based off of the final project in Boise State University's CS-321: 
"Data Structures" course.

## Summary

This program reads GeneBank (.gbk) files containing DNA sequence data and
counts the frequency of all subsequences of a given length (1 to 31, 
inclusive). This data is saved to disk in a file that can be easily queried
to get the frequency of any requested subsequence. Users can provide a query
file containing multiple subsequences, and the program will return the
frequencies of every subsequence.
